# ChoreBunny

[Heroku link][heroku] **NB:** Link to production site (not yet live!)

[heroku]: http://www.herokuapp.com

## Minimum Viable Product

ChoreBunny is a web application inspired by TaskRabbit that will be built using Ruby on Rails and React/Flux. The presentation twist is that instead of searching by *metro* area, you search by *rooms* in your house, and instead of *taskers*, you have your *children/workers/bunnies* to choose from to complete household chores.

By the end of Week 9, this app will, at a minimum, incorporate the following:

- [ ] New account creation, login, and guest/demo login.
- [ ] Smooth, bug-free navigation.
- [ ] Adequate seed data to demonstrate the site's features.
- [ ] The minimum features necessary for an TaskRabbit style emulation site: chore navigation, worker/bunny navigation and booking, full profile views and review writing/rating.
- [ ] Hosting on Heroku.
- [ ] CSS styling that matches the essence of TaskRabbit styling.
- [ ] A production README, replacing this README.

## Product Goals and Priorities

ChoreBunny will allow users to do the following:

- [ ] Create an account (MVP)
- [ ] Log in / Log out, as parent including as a Guest parent (MVP)
- [ ] Create, read, edit, and delete reviews of workers/bunnies (MVP)
- [ ] Search for workers/bunnies (MVP)
- [ ] Filter bunnies for chores by their ratings (expected feature, not MVP)
- [ ] Log in / Log out, as bunny including as a Guest bunny (desirable feature, but not MVP)

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Backend setup and User Authentication (0.5 days)

**Objective:** Functioning rails project with Authentication

the API.

- [ ] create `Note` model
- [ ] seed the database with a small amount of test data
- [ ] CRUD API for notes (`NotesController`)

user interface.

- [ ] setup the flux loop with skeleton files
- [ ] setup React Router

  - [ ] `NotesIndex`
  - [ ] `NoteIndexItem`
